In terms of the code, we're thinking something along the lines of...

```
>[, "something in here..."]
```

Our tape has 2 locations of interest.

----------
| A | B |
----------

A is the current number. B is the instruction that is inputted.

The hard part is trying to check which instruction B is.

We were thinking some kind of nested loop that tries to decrement B till it reaches 0 and then executing a certain instruction based on how soon it reaches 0.

Sorry if this doesn't make a lot of sense :/
We'll go over it together at the start of next week's meeting.
